# Golang

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

I have been learning Golang and using certain basic programming features to understand it. Starting from the most primitve aspects of understanding a language.

# Installation

## Windows

* [Official golang source download](https://golang.org/doc/install)
a zip archive that requires you to set some environment variables and an MSI installer that configures your installation automatically.

* MSI installer
Open the MSI file and follow the prompts to install the Go tools. By default, the installer puts the Go distribution in c:\Go.

The installer should put the c:\Go\bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open command prompts for the change to take effect.

* Zip archive
Download the zip file and extract it into the directory of your choice (we suggest c:\Go).

Add the bin subdirectory of your Go root (for example, c:\Go\bin) to your PATH environment variable.

## macOS package installer
Download the package file, open it, and follow the prompts to install the Go tools. The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go.

The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

# Run go

For your first program save your go file as

File-->Save as-->Name--> "abc.go" Save as--> .txt

Make sure to use the ""(double inverted commas)

Navigate to the saved directory where your source code file is saved.

Use go run abc.go to run the program
